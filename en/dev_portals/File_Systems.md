# Introduction
Most embedded devices use [flash memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory) as storage media.
Also, size and bootup time are very important in many consumer electronics products.  Therefore, 
special file systems are often used with differrent features, such as enhanced compression, or
the ability to execute files directly from flash.

# MTD
Note that flash memory may be managed by the Memory Technology Devices (MTD) system of Linux. See the [MTD/Flash FAQ](http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/faq/general.html)for more information.  Most of the 
filesystems mentioned here are built on top of the MTD system.
